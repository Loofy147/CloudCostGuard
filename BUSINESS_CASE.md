# Business Case: CloudCostGuard

## 1. Value Proposition & ROI

CloudCostGuard provides engineering teams with real-time, pre-commit cloud cost estimates, enabling them to prevent cloud waste before it happens. Our value proposition is simple: **we turn your engineers into a proactive FinOps team.**

The ROI for customers is direct and measurable:
- **Reduced Cloud Spend:** Customers can expect to reduce their cloud waste by 15-20% within the first six months.
- **Increased Developer Productivity:** Automating cost analysis saves valuable engineering time that would otherwise be spent on manual reviews or reacting to budget overruns.
- **Improved Cost Culture:** Fosters a culture of cost-awareness and accountability within the engineering organization.

## 2. TAM/SAM/SOM Analysis

- **Total Addressable Market (TAM):** The global cloud managed services market, valued at ~$86B. We are specifically targeting the cloud cost management sub-segment.
- **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):** Companies that use Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and have development teams of 10 or more. Estimated at $10B.
- **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):** Our initial goal is to capture $1M in ARR within the first two years, focusing on mid-market tech companies (50-500 engineers).

## 3. Revenue Model: Tiered SaaS

CloudCostGuard will be a B2B SaaS product with a tiered subscription model based on the number of active developers and advanced features.

| Tier | Price | Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Team** | $20/dev/month | Core functionality for up to 25 developers. GitHub integration. |
| **Business** | $40/dev/month | Adds support for GitLab/Bitbucket, custom policy enforcement, and basic predictive cost modeling. |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Adds advanced security features, on-premise deployment options, and dedicated support. |

## 4. Go-to-Market Strategy

- **Phase 1: Product-Led Growth (Bottom-up)**
  - A generous free tier and a smooth, self-service onboarding experience.
  - Content marketing focused on developer education (e.g., "The Ultimate Guide to Terraform Cost Estimation").
  - Integration with the GitHub Marketplace.
- **Phase 2: Sales-Led Growth (Top-down)**
  - Build a small sales team to target mid-market and enterprise accounts.
  - Develop partnerships with cloud providers and technology partners.

## 5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
- **Lifetime Value (LTV)**
- **Net Revenue Retention (NRR)**
- **Time to Value (TTV):** The time it takes for a new customer to configure the tool and receive their first PR cost estimate.

## Appendix: Market Sizing Calculation

**Note:** These are high-level estimates based on publicly available market data.

- **Total Addressable Market (TAM):** The global cloud managed services market is chosen as a proxy for the total potential spend on cloud-related tooling. Sources like Gartner and MarketsandMarkets value this at **~$86B in 2022**.

- **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):** We narrow the TAM to companies that are heavy users of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and have engineering teams large enough to feel the pain of cloud cost management (assumed 10+ engineers).
  - Estimated 40% of the cloud market uses IaC seriously.
  - Estimated 30% of that segment fits our target company size.
  - **Calculation:** $86B * 40% * 30% = **~$10.3B**.

- **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):** Our initial target is a niche within the SAM: mid-market tech companies in North America. We aim to capture a small but meaningful fraction of this market within two years.
  - Estimated size of this niche: ~$500M.
  - Target capture: 0.2% of this niche.
  - **Calculation:** $500M * 0.2% = **$1M ARR**.
